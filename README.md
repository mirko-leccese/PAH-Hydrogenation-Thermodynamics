# PAH-Hydrogenation-Thermodynamics

## Description
Fortran code to investigate the Thermodynamics of the stepwise-hydrogenation reaction of PAH molecules (such as coronene). TEST folder contains sample code outputs for coronene hydrogenation reaction, i.e. the stepwise addition of 24 H atoms. 

The code allows performing four types of analysis:
1. Temperature analysis: it computes partition functions for any hydrogenated species in a provided range of temperatures;
2. Pressure analysis: it computes pressure-dependent contribution to the Gibbs Free Energy in a provided range of partial pressures;
3. Random Walk mode: it simulates a mixture Free energy optimization starting from a promt composition of the mixture. The optimization details are given in the attached documentation;
4. Phase diagram mode: it simulates a phase diagram in a provided range of pressures ad temperatures.
